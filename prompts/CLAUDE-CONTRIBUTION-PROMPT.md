## 📋 **Current Project Status & Architecture**

### **✅ Completed Features**

- **Enhanced Configuration System**: 200+ configuration options via `service_overrides`
- **Architecture Intelligence**: Automatic ARM64/AMD64 detection and service placement
- **Mixed Cluster Support**: Strategic service placement across heterogeneous nodes
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Terraform native testing with make commands
- **Troubleshooting Automation**: Advanced diagnostic scripts with multiple modes
- **Security Hardening**: Resource limits, SSL certificates, policy framework
- **Version Management**: Automated release scripts and GitHub Actions CI/CD

### **⚙️ Key Configuration Patterns**

**Architecture Detection & Placement**:

```hcl
# Automatic mixed cluster handling
auto_mixed_cluster_mode = true
cpu_arch = ""  # Auto-detect from cluster

# Strategic service placement
cpu_arch_override = {
  traefik          = "amd64"  # Performance-critical
  prometheus       = "amd64"  # Resource-intensive
  grafana          = "arm64"  # UI services
  portainer        = "arm64"  # Efficient placement
}
```

**Service Override Framework**:

```hcl
service_overrides = {
  traefik = {
    cpu_arch         = "amd64"
    chart_version    = "26.0.0"
    storage_class    = "nfs-csi-safe"
    enable_dashboard = true
    cpu_limit        = "500m"
    memory_limit     = "512Mi"
    helm_timeout     = 600
  }
}
```

**Flexible Service Selection**:

```hcl
services = {
  traefik    = true   # Essential ingress
  metallb    = true   # Load balancing
  prometheus = true   # Core monitoring
  consul     = false  # Optional service mesh
  vault      = false  # Optional secrets management
}
```

## 🛠️ **Contribution Requirements & Standards**

### **🧪 Testing Framework Requirements**

All contributions must pass the comprehensive testing suite:

```bash
# Required test commands
make test-safe              # Lint + validate + unit + scenarios
make test-all              # Complete test suite including integration
make test-unit             # Architecture logic, storage, helm configs
make test-scenarios        # ARM64, mixed clusters, storage configurations
make test-integration      # Live infrastructure validation
```

### **📁 File Structure Standards**

```
tf-kube-any-compute/
├── main.tf                 # Service deployments
├── variables.tf            # Input variables with validation
├── locals.tf              # Centralized configuration logic
├── outputs.tf             # Service outputs and debug info
├── terraform.tfvars.example  # Usage scenarios
├── .github/workflows/     # CI/CD automation
├── scripts/               # Release and diagnostic scripts
├── helm-*/                # Individual service modules
└── test-configs/          # Test scenarios
```

### **🔧 Code Quality Standards**

**Terraform Best Practices**:

- Use `terraform fmt` for consistent formatting
- Add validation rules to all variables
- Follow override pattern: `user_override → computed_default → fallback`
- Centralize logic in `locals.tf`
- Provide comprehensive variable descriptions

**Variable Definition Pattern**:

```hcl
variable "service_name" {
  description = "Clear description of purpose and impact"
  type        = object({
    option1 = string
    option2 = optional(bool, false)
  })
  default = {}

  validation {
    condition     = can(regex("^[a-z-]+$", var.service_name.option1))
    error_message = "Service name must be lowercase with hyphens."
  }
}
```

### **🏗️ Architecture-Aware Development**

**Mixed Cluster Considerations**:

- Always test on both ARM64 and AMD64 architectures
- Consider resource constraints on Raspberry Pi environments
- Implement intelligent service placement logic
- Test architecture override functionality

**Storage Strategy Implementation**:

- Support both NFS and HostPath storage backends
- Implement storage class selection logic
- Consider multi-node vs single-node scenarios
