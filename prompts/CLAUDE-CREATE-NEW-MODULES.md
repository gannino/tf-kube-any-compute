# Terraform Modules Contribution Request

Based on your analysis of the tf-kube-any-compute project, I'd like to contribute by creating two new service integration modules that would be valuable for homelab automation and workflow orchestration.

## My Contribution Goal

I want to create **two new Terraform modules** for popular automation and workflow services:

### 1. Node-RED Module
- **Service**: Visual programming tool for IoT and automation
- **Chart**: `node-red` from `https://schwarzit.github.io/node-red-chart/`
- **Version**: `0.35.0`

### 2. n8n Module
- **Service**: Workflow automation platform
- **Chart**: `community-charts/n8n` from `https://community-charts.github.io/helm-charts`
- **Version**: `1.14.1`

## Why These Services?

Both services are perfect fits for the homelab-first philosophy of tf-kube-any-compute:

- **Node-RED**: Essential for IoT device integration, home automation, and visual workflow creation
- **n8n**: Powerful alternative to Zapier/IFTTT for self-hosted workflow automation
- Both work excellently on ARM64 (Raspberry Pi) and are popular in homelab communities
- They complement the existing monitoring and service mesh capabilities

## My Experience Level

- **Terraform/IaC**: Advanced - extensive experience with modules, testing, and best practices
- **Kubernetes/Helm**: Advanced - comfortable with charts, values, and service configuration
- **Homelab**: Intermediate - familiar with Pi clusters and resource constraints
- **Architecture**: Both services should support mixed ARM64/AMD64 deployments

## Implementation Approach

I plan to follow the established module patterns:

```
helm-node-red/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf                 # Helm release and resources
â”œâ”€â”€ variables.tf            # Service overrides and configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ outputs.tf              # Service endpoints and connection info
â”œâ”€â”€ locals.tf               # Computed values and conditionals
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ values.yaml.tpl     # Helm values template
â””â”€â”€ README.md               # Documentation

n8n/
â”œâ”€â”€ [same structure]
```

Both modules will include:
- Full service_overrides integration
- Traefik ingress with SSL support
- Authentication middleware compatibility
- ARM64/AMD64 architecture support
- NFS-CSI and HostPath storage options
- Comprehensive variable validation
- Complete test coverage

## Configuration Requirements

Based on your guidance:

### Storage Strategy
- Follow repository standards and user configuration patterns
- Leverage existing NFS-CSI primary with HostPath fallback approach

### Authentication Integration
- Initially deploy without custom authentication
- Authentication patterns will be evaluated after testing phase

### Resource Allocation
- **Priority**: Low resource consumption for small compute environments
- Target Raspberry Pi and resource-constrained deployments
- Optimize for homelab hardware limitations

### Testing Scope
- Focus on core service functionality testing
- Ensure services deploy and operate correctly on target hardware
- Validate basic automation/workflow capabilities

## Implementation Questions

Could you provide specific implementation guidance for these modules, including:

1. **Module Structure**: Any tf-kube-any-compute specific patterns for automation services?
2. **Resource Limits**: Recommended default CPU/memory limits for Pi deployments?
3. **Service Configuration**: Best practices for exposing these services within the existing architecture?
4. **Testing Framework**: Specific test patterns I should follow for these service types?

Ready to implement these modules following the established patterns and contributing to the homelab automation ecosystem! ðŸš€
