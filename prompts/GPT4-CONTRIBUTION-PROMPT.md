### **🎯 Key Configuration Patterns**

**Smart Architecture Placement**:

```hcl
# Automatic detection with manual overrides
cpu_arch = ""  # Auto-detect from cluster
auto_mixed_cluster_mode = true

# Strategic service placement
cpu_arch_override = {
  traefik          = "amd64"  # High-performance ingress
  prometheus_stack = "amd64"  # Resource-intensive monitoring
  grafana          = "arm64"  # Efficient UI services
  portainer        = "arm64"  # Management interfaces
}
```

**Flexible Service Configuration**:

```hcl
service_overrides = {
  traefik = {
    cpu_arch         = "amd64"
    chart_version    = "26.0.0"
    storage_class    = "nfs-csi-safe"
    enable_dashboard = true
    cert_resolver    = "wildcard"
    cpu_limit        = "500m"
    memory_limit     = "512Mi"
    helm_timeout     = 600
    helm_wait        = true
  }
}
```

**Environment-Specific Service Selection**:

```hcl
# Raspberry Pi optimized
services = {
  traefik    = true   # Essential ingress
  metallb    = true   # Load balancing
  host_path  = true   # Local storage
  prometheus = true   # Core monitoring
  grafana    = true   # Visualization
  consul     = false  # Disable heavy services
  vault      = false  # Resource optimization
}

# Full production stack
services = {
  traefik = true
  metallb = true
  nfs_csi = true
  prometheus = true
  grafana = true
  loki = true
  consul = true
  vault = true
  portainer = true
  gatekeeper = false  # Optional policy engine
}
```

### **🔧 Code Quality Requirements**

**Terraform Best Practices**:

- Use `terraform fmt` for consistent formatting
- Implement comprehensive variable validation
- Follow the configuration hierarchy pattern
- Centralize computed logic in `locals.tf`
- Provide detailed variable descriptions and examples

**Variable Definition Standard**:

```hcl
variable "service_configuration" {
  description = <<-EOT
    Comprehensive service configuration object supporting:
    - Architecture-specific deployment options
    - Resource limits and requests
    - Storage class and size customization
    - Helm chart version and timeout settings
    - Security and networking parameters

    Example:
    {
      cpu_arch      = "amd64"
      storage_class = "nfs-csi-safe"
      cpu_limit     = "500m"
      memory_limit  = "512Mi"
    }
  EOT

  type = object({
    cpu_arch      = optional(string, "")
    storage_class = optional(string, "")
    cpu_limit     = optional(string, "")
    memory_limit  = optional(string, "")
    # ... additional options
  })

  default = {}

  validation {
    condition = can(regex("^(amd64|arm64|)$", var.service_configuration.cpu_arch))
    error_message = "CPU architecture must be 'amd64', 'arm64', or empty for auto-detection."
  }
}
```

### **🏗️ Architecture-Aware Development**

**Multi-Architecture Considerations**:

- Test on both ARM64 (Raspberry Pi) and AMD64 (x86) architectures
- Implement intelligent service placement logic
- Consider resource constraints and optimization opportunities
- Validate cross-architecture compatibility

**Storage Strategy Implementation**:

- Support multiple storage backends (NFS, HostPath, cloud storage)
- Implement storage class selection and fallback logic
- Consider performance implications of storage choices
- Test across single-node and multi-node scenarios

**Performance Optimization**:

- Implement resource limits appropriate for target environments
- Consider memory and CPU constraints on Raspberry Pi
- Optimize container image selection for architecture
- Balance features with resource consumption
